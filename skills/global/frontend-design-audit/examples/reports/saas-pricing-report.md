**Interface type:** SaaS marketing / pricing page

### How to Read This Report
Findings are rated on a 0-4 severity scale (4 = users can't complete tasks,
1 = cosmetic only). Each finding references an established usability principle.
Start from the top -- the most impactful issues are listed first.

### Summary

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| 4 - Catastrophe | 1 |
| 3 - Major | 5 |
| 2 - Minor | 8 |
| 1 - Cosmetic | 4 |
| **Total findings** | **18** |

### Quick Wins
The highest-impact issues that are also straightforward to fix:
1. Billing toggle is a non-semantic div with no keyboard or screen reader support (Severity 4) -- replace with a `<button role="switch">` with `aria-checked` and keyboard handling
2. FAQ questions are non-semantic divs, inaccessible to keyboard users (Severity 3) -- replace with `<button>` elements and add `aria-expanded`
3. No skip-to-content link for keyboard navigation (Severity 3) -- add a visually-hidden skip link as the first focusable element
4. No visible focus indicators on any interactive element (Severity 3) -- add a global `:focus-visible` rule
5. Missing `<main>` landmark and `<nav>` aria-label (Severity 3) -- wrap content in `<main>` and label the nav

### Findings

#### [Severity 4] F1: Billing toggle is a non-semantic div with no keyboard or screen reader support
- **Principle:** Accessibility (13), Affordances and Signifiers (11)
- **Location:** `saas-pricing.html:174` (the `<div class="toggle">` element)
- **Issue:** The monthly/yearly billing toggle is a plain `<div>` with an `onclick` handler. It has no `role`, no `tabindex`, no `aria-checked` attribute, and no keyboard event handler. Screen reader users cannot perceive or operate it. Keyboard-only users cannot reach it via Tab.
- **User impact:** Any user who relies on a keyboard or assistive technology is completely unable to switch billing periods. This is a core pricing interaction -- users are blocked from seeing annual pricing and the 20% savings. This also creates potential legal exposure under WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirements.
- **Fix:** Replace the `<div>` with `<button role="switch" aria-checked="false" aria-label="Switch to yearly billing">`. Add a `keydown` listener for Enter/Space. Update `aria-checked` and the label dynamically when toggled.

#### [Severity 3] F2: FAQ questions are non-semantic divs, inaccessible to keyboard and screen readers
- **Principle:** Accessibility (13), Affordances and Signifiers (11)
- **Location:** `saas-pricing.html:269-301` (all `.faq-question` divs)
- **Issue:** Each FAQ question is a `<div>` with an inline `onclick`. No `role="button"`, no `tabindex`, no keyboard handler, no `aria-expanded` attribute. Screen readers cannot announce these as interactive, and keyboard users cannot reach them.
- **User impact:** Keyboard and assistive technology users cannot open any FAQ answers. Users who need FAQ information to make a purchasing decision (refund policy, free tier details) are blocked without a mouse.
- **Fix:** Use `<button>` elements for FAQ questions. Add `aria-expanded="false"` (toggled on open) and `aria-controls` pointing to the answer's `id`.

---

#### [Severity 3] F3: No skip-to-content link for keyboard navigation
- **Principle:** Flexibility and Efficiency (7), Accessibility (13)
- **Location:** `saas-pricing.html:153` (start of `<body>`)
- **Issue:** There is no skip navigation link. Keyboard users must tab through 5+ navigation links, the hero content, and the billing toggle before reaching the pricing cards -- the primary content.
- **User impact:** Keyboard users waste significant time tabbing through navigation on every page visit before reaching the content they came for.
- **Fix:** Add `<a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>` as the first element in `<body>`, styled off-screen until focused.

---

#### [Severity 3] F4: No visible focus indicators on any interactive element
- **Principle:** Accessibility (13), Perceptibility (14)
- **Location:** Global CSS -- no `:focus-visible` or `:focus` styles defined anywhere
- **Issue:** The stylesheet defines `:hover` states for buttons, links, and nav items, but zero `:focus` or `:focus-visible` styles. Browser default outlines are often invisible or too subtle against this page's color scheme.
- **User impact:** Keyboard users cannot see which element is currently focused. They tab blindly, unable to tell where they are on the page. This affects all interactive elements: nav links, pricing buttons, FAQ toggles, footer links.
- **Fix:** Add a global `:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid #6366f1; outline-offset: 2px; }` rule.

---

#### [Severity 3] F5: Flat typography hierarchy in pricing cards -- plan names, descriptions, and features lack differentiation
- **Principle:** Aesthetic and Minimalist Design (8), Perceptibility (14)
- **Location:** `saas-pricing.html:71-80` (`.plan-name` at 1.1rem/600, `.plan-desc` at 0.9rem, `.plan-features li` at 0.9rem)
- **Issue:** The plan name is only `1.1rem` at weight `600` in muted color `#64748b` -- it doesn't visually anchor the card. The plan description and feature list items are both `0.9rem`, making them visually indistinguishable in weight. The overall card reads as a flat block of text rather than a scannable hierarchy. Across three cards, users must read linearly instead of scanning plan names, then prices, then features.
- **User impact:** Users comparing three plans cannot quickly scan and differentiate them. The plan name -- the single most important identifier on each card -- visually recedes. This slows the comparison process on a page whose entire purpose is enabling fast plan selection.
- **Fix:** Increase plan name to `1.35rem` weight `700` in dark color. Make feature text slightly smaller (`0.85rem`) and lighter (`#64748b`). Increase spacing between the price block and features to create clear visual zones within each card.

---

#### [Severity 2] F6: No `<main>` landmark -- page has no primary content region for screen readers
- **Principle:** Accessibility (13), Structure (12)
- **Location:** `saas-pricing.html:153-350` (entire `<body>`)
- **Issue:** The page content is not wrapped in a `<main>` element. The `<header>` exists but there is no `<main>` to indicate primary content. The `<nav>` inside the header also lacks an `aria-label`.
- **User impact:** Screen reader users who navigate by landmarks cannot jump to the main content area. They must traverse the entire DOM sequentially.
- **Fix:** Wrap content from the hero through the CTA section in `<main id="main-content">`. Add `aria-label="Main navigation"` to the `<nav>`.

---

#### [Severity 2] F7: Comparison table checkmarks and crosses have no text alternative
- **Principle:** Perceptibility (14), Accessibility (13)
- **Location:** `saas-pricing.html:253-260` (table cells using `&#10003;` and `&#10005;`)
- **Issue:** The comparison table uses Unicode checkmark and cross characters to indicate feature availability. Screen readers may read these inconsistently or skip them entirely. No `aria-label` or visually-hidden text provides a clear "Included" / "Not included" alternative.
- **User impact:** Screen reader users may not be able to determine which features are included in which plan, undermining the purpose of the comparison table.
- **Fix:** Wrap symbols in `<span aria-hidden="true">` and add `<span class="sr-only">Included</span>` / `<span class="sr-only">Not included</span>` alongside them.

---

#### [Severity 2] F8: Nav links hidden on mobile with no hamburger menu or alternative
- **Principle:** User Control and Freedom (3), Structure (12)
- **Location:** `saas-pricing.html:148` (`nav a:not(.nav-cta) { display: none; }`)
- **Issue:** On viewports 768px and below, all navigation links except the CTA are hidden with `display: none`. There is no hamburger menu, drawer, or any other mechanism to access Features, Pricing, Docs, or Blog on mobile.
- **User impact:** Mobile users completely lose access to four navigation links. They cannot browse Features or Docs before making a purchase decision.
- **Fix:** Add a hamburger menu button that toggles a mobile navigation dropdown containing all links.

---

#### [Severity 2] F9: Toggle state relies on color alone -- ambiguous for color-blind users
- **Principle:** Perceptibility (14), Accessibility (13)
- **Location:** `saas-pricing.html:172-177` (toggle container)
- **Issue:** The billing toggle communicates state through background color (gray vs. purple) and knob position. The "active" label class only changes text color. There is no text weight, underline, or other non-color cue to reinforce which option is selected.
- **User impact:** Color-blind users may struggle to determine whether monthly or yearly billing is selected.
- **Fix:** Add `font-weight: 700` or an underline to the active label in addition to the color change.

---

#### [Severity 2] F10: Footer bottom links have insufficient contrast and no link affordance
- **Principle:** Accessibility (13), Affordances and Signifiers (11)
- **Location:** `saas-pricing.html:345-347` (inline `style="color:#94a3b8;text-decoration:none;"`)
- **Issue:** Privacy, Terms, and Cookies links use `color: #94a3b8` on white (~3.0:1 contrast -- below WCAG AA 4.5:1 minimum). The `text-decoration: none` removes the underline, so these links look identical to surrounding non-interactive text. Inline styles also prevent hover states.
- **User impact:** Users with low vision may not read these links. All users may not realize they are clickable.
- **Fix:** Darken the link color to at least `#64748b`. Add hover underline. Move inline styles to the stylesheet.

---

#### [Severity 2] F11: Plan description and price period text have low contrast
- **Principle:** Accessibility (13), Perceptibility (14)
- **Location:** `saas-pricing.html:73-74` (`.plan-price span { color: #94a3b8 }` and `.plan-desc { color: #94a3b8 }`)
- **Issue:** The "/mo" text after prices and plan description text use `#94a3b8` on white (~3.0:1 contrast), below WCAG AA's 4.5:1 requirement.
- **User impact:** Users with moderate vision impairments or in bright lighting may struggle to read plan descriptions, which provide useful context for choosing a plan.
- **Fix:** Darken the color to at least `#64748b` (4.6:1).

---

#### [Severity 2] F12: Uniform section spacing reduces visual structure across the page
- **Principle:** Aesthetic and Minimalist Design (8), Structure (12)
- **Location:** Global CSS -- section padding/margins throughout
- **Issue:** Spacing between major page sections is inconsistent but without a clear hierarchy. Hero bottom padding is `3rem`, pricing bottom is `4rem`, comparison is `2rem`, FAQ is `4rem`. The transition from pricing cards to comparison table has insufficient breathing room. There are no visual dividers or background color changes to demarcate sections.
- **User impact:** Users scrolling through the page don't get clear visual cues about where one section ends and another begins. The page feels like one continuous flow rather than distinct scannable sections.
- **Fix:** Establish a clear spacing hierarchy with generous separation (`5-6rem`) between major sections. Add subtle section dividers or alternating background colors.

---

#### [Severity 2] F13: CTA buttons lack active/pressed states
- **Principle:** Visibility of System Status (1), Affordances and Signifiers (11)
- **Location:** CSS for `.plan-btn`, `.cta-btn`, `.nav-cta`
- **Issue:** All buttons have hover states but no `:active` style. When a user clicks, there's no visual depression or change to confirm the click registered.
- **User impact:** Users may feel uncertain about whether their click was recognized. The interface feels slightly unresponsive.
- **Fix:** Add `:active` states with `transform: translateY(1px)` and reduced shadow for filled buttons.

---

#### [Severity 1] F14: Plan name divs should be semantic heading elements
- **Principle:** Accessibility (13), Structure (12)
- **Location:** `saas-pricing.html:182, 199, 216` (`.plan-name` divs)
- **Issue:** Plan names ("Starter," "Professional," "Enterprise") use `<div class="plan-name">` instead of heading elements. Screen reader users navigating by headings will skip from the page `<h1>` to the comparison `<h2>`, missing the pricing cards.
- **User impact:** Heading-based navigation skips the most important content on the page -- the actual pricing plans.
- **Fix:** Change `.plan-name` from `<div>` to `<h3>`.

---

#### [Severity 1] F15: Comparison table section rows use `<td>` instead of `<th>`
- **Principle:** Accessibility (13), Structure (12)
- **Location:** `saas-pricing.html:246, 251, 259` (rows with class `section-row`)
- **Issue:** Section grouping rows ("Storage & Sync," "Collaboration," "Security") use `<td colspan="4">` instead of `<th>`. They function as headers but are not semantically marked.
- **User impact:** Screen reader users navigating the table will not understand the grouping structure.
- **Fix:** Change `<td colspan="4">` to `<th colspan="4" scope="colgroup">`.

---

#### [Severity 1] F16: Missing Open Graph meta tags for social sharing
- **Principle:** Match Between System and Real World (2)
- **Location:** `saas-pricing.html:7-8` (the `<head>` section)
- **Issue:** The page includes `og:title` but is missing `og:description`, `og:image`, `og:url`, and `og:type`. Social media link previews will be incomplete.
- **User impact:** When shared on social media, the link preview will lack a description and image, reducing click-through rates.
- **Fix:** Add `og:description`, `og:image`, `og:url`, and `og:type="website"` meta tags.

---

#### [Severity 1] F17: No `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- **Principle:** Flexibility and Efficiency (7), Perceptibility (14)
- **Location:** Throughout the CSS -- multiple `transition` properties on toggle, cards, buttons, FAQ arrow
- **Issue:** The page uses several CSS transitions but never checks `prefers-reduced-motion`. Users who have enabled reduced motion in their OS settings will still see all animations.
- **User impact:** Users with vestibular disorders or motion sensitivity may experience discomfort from the animations.
- **Fix:** Add `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) { *, *::before, *::after { animation-duration: 0.01ms !important; transition-duration: 0.01ms !important; } }`.

### Strengths

1. **Strong visual foundation and brand identity.** The page has a clean, modern aesthetic with a cohesive indigo color palette. The featured plan card is well-differentiated with a purple border, gradient background, and "Most Popular" badge. Users can immediately identify the recommended plan. This satisfies **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design (8)** and **Affordances and Signifiers (11)**.

2. **Well-structured information architecture.** The page follows a logical top-to-bottom decision funnel: value proposition (hero), billing toggle, pricing comparison, detailed feature table, FAQ for objection handling, and final CTA with trust signals ("No credit card required. Cancel anytime."). This mirrors how buyers evaluate pricing. This satisfies **Structure (12)** and **Match Between System and Real World (2)**.

3. **Excellent plain-language copy.** The page avoids technical jargon throughout. Plan names, feature descriptions, FAQ answers, and CTAs all use natural user-facing language. Trust-building phrases address common purchase anxieties proactively. This satisfies **Match Between System and Real World (2)** and **Help and Documentation (10)**.

4. **Solid responsive layout foundation.** The page includes sensible mobile breakpoints: pricing grid collapses to single-column, footer adjusts to two columns, hero text scales down. The viewport meta tag is correctly configured without zoom-blocking. This satisfies **Flexibility and Efficiency (7)**.

5. **Effective progressive disclosure in FAQ.** The FAQ accordion lets users scan questions without being overwhelmed by all answers at once. This is appropriate minimalist design for secondary information. This satisfies **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design (8)** and **Recognition Over Recall (6)**.
